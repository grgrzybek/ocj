= Open Container Initiative for Java

This is a proof of concept for Java tools and libraries implementing specifications from https://opencontainers.org[Open Container Initiative].

== Background

The trend for rootless containers lead to where we are now and where three tools are used to manage containers and images:

* https://podman.io/[Podman]
* https://buildah.io/[Buildah]
* https://github.com/containers/skopeo[Skopeo]

These tools use libraries from https://github.com/containers organization:

* https://github.com/containers/common
* https://github.com/containers/image
* https://github.com/containers/storage

These libraries (together) implement the following specification from OCI:

* https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec[OCI Runtime Specification]
* https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec[OCI Image Format Specification]
* https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec[OCI Distribution Specification]

Kubernetes provides https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api[CRI API specification] for a `kubelet` to communicate with actual https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/[container runtime] and by itself, Kubernetes provides https://cri-o.io/[CRI-O implementation] of CRI specification.

== Java landspace (as far as I checked recently)

Focusing on Maven plugins, we have:

* https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin[Fabric8 docker-maven-plugin]
* https://github.com/eclipse/jkube[Kubernetes and OpenShift maven plugins] at Eclipse (donated from https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin[fabric8-maven-plugin])

These tools rely on Docker daemon (which may be replaced by `podman system service`).

== Goal

It's not even a goal now, just an idea - can we have libraries that can be used for rootless container/image management in pure Javaâ„¢?

Can we emulate `podman`, `buildah` and `skopeo` functionality in Java?

Can we talk to CRI-O daemon from Java?

=== Quick search

"Java OCI implementation" search reveals information about https://github.com/oracle/oci-java-sdk[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure], not about https://opencontainers.org[Open Container Initiative].

There's a https://github.com/lexemmens/podman-maven-plugin[podman-maven-plugin] from Lex Emmens, but it wraps `podman` command invocation using https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-exec[ProcessExecutor from ZeroTurnaround].
